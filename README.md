# apc524-final-project
Princeton University APC524 Final Project


## Install and Run the Project

To make use of our strategies and backtests, start by cloning the repository. Then, create any Python file and import the desired classes from src.tradestrat. For example, if a momentum-based strategy is desired, the following can be written in the Python file:
```
from src.tradestrat import Momentum, Backtest
```

For details on how to use the classes and methods, see tutorials.ipynb.
