# Trading Strategies in Python

This project allows users to create portfolios based on various trading strategies. These strategies range from being based in traditional finance (such as the Momentum strategy) to using machine learning techniques (in the MLStrat strategy). Users can then backtest the results of the strategies using the methods of the Backtest class.

Overall, this project allows users to test the effectiveness of various trading strategies, allowing users to trade more successfully in future as well.
